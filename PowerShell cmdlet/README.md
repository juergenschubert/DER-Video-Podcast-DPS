cmdlet developement

Here you find the answer to my customers question
I need to check my DataDomain local users - I have 700 DDs all over the world

Answer of the SE ... no problem I build a cmdlet for you to do this.

Herre you do find a way how you can create your own cmdlet and NO I am not a sw developer !
The ps1 script contains actions you have to execute and comments you should read. 
After this exercise you should have a cmdlet which does
connect to your DataDomain
lookup local DD USER

and might throw errors
