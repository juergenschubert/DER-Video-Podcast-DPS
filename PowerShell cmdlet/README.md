cmdlet developement

Here you find the answer to my customers question
I need to check my DataDomain local users - I have 700 DDs all over the world

Answer of the SE ... no problem I build a cmdlet for you to do this.

Herre you do find a way how you can create your own cmdlet and NO I am not a sw developer !
The ps1 script contains actions you have to execute and comments you should read. 
After this exercise you should have a cmdlet which does
connect to your DataDomain
lookup local DD USER

and might throw errors 

Start downloading the ps1 and start reading and you will see some downloads and installs are needed but a connection to a DD with DDOS 7.2 at least as well.  
You can run this in our DELL DemoCenter when you provision HOL-0411-01 at least with the Nov 2020 version of it.  
Otherwise look for a DD min DDOS 7.2 with internet access. You should find many of these HOLs.
